# Post Author Taxonomy

**Simple & lightweight:** Registers a simple post authors taxonomy for the regular Posts post type. The taxonomy is not hierarchical, so it's similar to tags but for authors instead. Shortcodes for a list of authors and an Author Box are included.

## Description

Very useful to add and display a list of authors to a blog post. If you don't want to use the built-in author, then this plugin/snippet is for you. By default WordPress can only handle one author per post (or post type). Handling multiple authors via a taxonomy is the simplest and most lightweight way to do that. You can then work with that data in your content, templates and your favorite builder.

*Backstory:* I needed something like that for a client project to display a simple list of post authors. The client didn't wanted to add each author as WordPress user therefore the plugin "Co Authors Plus" was not a possible option. Also, the taxonomy solution is simpler, more user friendly and more flexible.

---

## Features

* By default an `Authors` Taxonomy added for regular WordPress Posts (post type: `post`)
* Shortcode for adding a list of authors, for example in a single post (template) â€“ comma separated list of authors
* Shortcode for adding an author box, for example in a single post (or template) â€“ one author per box
* Can be used with Classic Editor and the Block Editor (Gutenberg)
* Can be used perfectly fine with most Page Builders (Bricks, Breakdance, Oxygen, Elementor etc.) â€“ just use the taxonomy data in your favorite builder's dynamic data feature, you won't need the Shortcodes I guess :-)
* Developer friendly: customize or extend via filters, styles and styling-friendly CSS classes
* Fully internationalized and translateable! -- German translations already packaged!
* Developed with security in mind: proper WordPress coding standards and security functions - escape all the things! :)

---

## Widget Usage

NO LONGER recommended! Widgets are outdated, I do not recommend them (and _didn't_ use them myself for lots of years already!).

Shortcode could be used with "Text" widget -- if you have Shortcodes for Widgets activated. Possible via this filter:
```
add_filter( 'widget_text', 'do_shortcode' );
```
If using extended/ advanced text widget plugins, the Shortcode usage then is already enabled automatically... :-)

---

## Template Usage (Developers)

Use WordPress' global `do_shortcode()` function as a template function, like so:
```
<?php do_shortcode( '[pat-authors]' ); ?>
```
--> parameters apply like for regular Shortcode usage (see above)!

---

## Plugin Filters (Developers)

* `pat/filter/taxonomy/params` --> filter all Taxonomy parameters
* `pat/filter/shortcode/authors_list_defaults` --> filter authors list Shortcode defaults
* `pat/filter/shortcode/authors-list` --> filter authors list Shortcode output
* `pat/filter/shortcode/author_box_defaults` --> filter author box Shortcode defaults
* `pat/filter/shortcode/author-box` --> filter author box Shortcode output
